Copy to clipboard straight from the Android "Share" menu.

Hooks into the Android native Share system for seamless integration.

No more annoying workarounds to do something that is so useful and essential.

Unique to this app is that we also support sharing VCards (contact) and plan on adding many others.

Also, unlike many other solutions, this one doesn't have any visual bugs and phantom windows, just click share to copy from any app, and paste anywhere you like!

Thanks to many contributors, the app is available in many languages.
